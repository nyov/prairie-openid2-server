>> WELCOME
   This is the 2nd alpha release of Prairie; our Internet identity server. 
   The script is stable, but not tested outside of our servers. If you have 
   downloaded this we ask you to join our testing team and report bugs, 
   usability or assessibility issues. Prairie is and will always remain 
   lightweight. The documentation should help you install, run and customise 
   Prairie, so we are also looking for feedback on that as well.

   Support (you can't work something, something broke, something did 
   something different to what you understand it is meant to do)
